Presents the prevalence of disabilities among prison and jail inmates,
detailing the prevalence of six specific disability types: hearing, vision,
cognitive, ambulatory, self-care, and independent living. Important
differences in each type of disability are highlighted by demographic
characteristics. The report also assesses the prevalence of disabilities
with other health problems, such as a current chronic condition, obesity,
ever having an infectious disease, and past 30-day serious psychological
distress. Findings are based on prison and jail inmate self-reported data
from BJS’s 2011–12 National Inmate Survey (NIS-3). Data from the 2012
American Community Survey (ACS) and 2009–2012 National Survey on Drug Use
and Health (NSDUH) were used to compare the incarcerated populations to the
noninstitutionalized general population.
